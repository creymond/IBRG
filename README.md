# IBRG

Research about Multi-agent systems, Belief Revision and Knowledge Representation conducted at 
National Institute of Imformatics (Tokyo, Japan) and Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University  (Lyon, France).

## Description

Iterated Belief Revision Games (IBRG) is a research concerned with the evolution of beliefs
of a groupd of communicating agents. This is a simple game with only non-human players. At each step of the game,
agents communicate their beliefs with neighbors and revise their own belief base. The belief revision model used
is the AGM logic upgraded by iterated change theory from Darwiche and Pearl. The application in this repository allow one
to play IBRGs with multiple settings. For more information, please read my Master Thesis attached.
